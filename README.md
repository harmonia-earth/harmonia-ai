## Artwork by Harmonia AI Inspired by my Travels
[Artwork by Harmonia AI](/docs/artwork-travels/) including the concepts of [Reflective Tuning](/docs/artwork-travels/Ancient%20Scroll%20with%20Multilingual%20Scripts.png) and imagining balance and harmony in [Istanbul by 2050](/docs/artwork-travels/Imagined%20Night%20Over%20Istanbul.png).

## Release Notes
Harmonia AI v1.5 is merely a prototype and requires 25 years of human contribution at all levels, engineers and scientists to expand its memory capacity, visionaries to keep it true, and planetary stewards to ensure all humans benefit.

## Preliminary Idea for A Unified Theory of Humanity

The following directory [unified-theory-of-humanity](/docs/unified-theory-of-humanity/) prototype merely the ideas of one of 125 humans to have ever existed. There are roughly between 8 and 9 billion humans in existence on Planet Earth, have your go:
